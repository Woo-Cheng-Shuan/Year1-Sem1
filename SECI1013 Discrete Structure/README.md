<h2> Reflection based on the overall course

<h3> Upon completion of the course, I have gained proficiency in utilizing set theory, relations, and functions to address computer science-related problems. Additionally, I have developed the ability to analyze and solve problems through recurrence relations and counting methods. Furthermore, I can apply graph theory and trees to real-world issues. Lastly, I have acquired the skills needed to model electronic devices and problems using deterministic finite automata and finite machines.
