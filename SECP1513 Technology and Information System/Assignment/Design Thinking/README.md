<h2> Reflection

<h3> a. What is your goal/ dream with regard to your course/ program?  
I wish to master all topics and subjects in my course during these four years. Since my course is going to have long term internship compared to the others, I must have good skill to let me handle the stuff in internship or in the future. These four years are the main time that I could build my foundation. 
  

<h3> b. How does this design thinking impact on your goal/ dream with regard to your program?  
Besides, I think this design thinking project let me know how the process is to develop and build the application and product to fulfil user’s requirements. I get to know how to create problem, communication and solve with a team. 
  

<h3> c. What is the action/ improvement/ plan necessary for you to improve your potential in this industry. 
Not only that, but I will attend some extra course to improve my IT knowledge and skills. This is because we will do many hands-on projects which is tougher than this. “Never stop learning”, a quote from Mr Ninderjit that I heard from the industry visit.
