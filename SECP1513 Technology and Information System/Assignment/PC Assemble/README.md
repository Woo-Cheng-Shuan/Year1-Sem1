<h2> Reflection


<h3> Assembling a desktop CPU proved to be a valuable and empowering experience that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge, develop problem-solving skills, and gain practical, hands-on experience. Throughout the class, the lecturer provided detailed explanations of the various components that make up a CPU and guided us through the step-by-step process of assembling and disassembling the device. This experience deepened my understanding of the functions of critical components such as the motherboard, RAM, and power supply within the system. It also piqued my interest in staying updated with the latest hardware trends and advancements in the rapidly evolving world of computer technology.
