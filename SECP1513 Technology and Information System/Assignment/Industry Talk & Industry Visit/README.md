<h2> Reflection


<h3> Throughout this semester, our course afforded us the opportunity to visit two prominent companies and a key sector that holds a significant position within our university. These industrial visits provided an extensive outlook of a sector that plays a crucial role in shaping the future. As a first-year computer science student, I gained insight into the collaborative work environments and the essential skills required before joining a company. This early realization has allowed me to optimize my time and efforts throughout the next four years of my studies.
